                            <p>We will use this information to carry out our obligations arising from any contracts entered into between you and us including and to provide you with the information, products and services that you request from us, and to provide you with information about other goods and services we offer that are similar to those that you have already purchased or enquired about.

                            <p>We may also use this information to provide you, or permit selected third parties to provide you, with information about goods or services we feel may interest you. If you are an existing customer, we will only contact you by electronic means (e-mail or SMS) with information about goods and services similar to those which were the subject of a previous sale or negotiations of a sale to you. If you are a new customer, and where we permit selected third parties to use your data, we (or they) will contact you by electronic means only if you have consented to this. If you do not want us to use your data in this way, or to pass your details on to third parties for marketing purposes, please tick the relevant box situated on the form on which we collect your data (the registration form).</p>
                            <p><strong>Information We Collect About You</strong></p>
                            <p>We will use this information to administer our Site and for internal operations, including troubleshooting, data analysis, testing, research, statistical and survey purposes and to help keep our Site safe and secure.</p>

We may also use the information to measure and understand the effectiveness of advertising we serve to you and others, and to deliver relevant advertising to you.</p>
                            <p><strong>Information We Receive From Other Sources</strong></p>
                            <p>We may combine this information with information you give to us and information we collect about you. We may use this information and the combined information for the purposes set out above (depending on the types of information we receive).</p>
                            <hr />
                            <p><strong>Disclosure Of Your Information</strong></p>
                            <p>We may share your personal information with any member of our group, which means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries, as defined in section 1159 of the UK Companies Act 2006.</p>
                            <p>We may share your information with selected third parties including business partners, suppliers and sub-contractors for the performance of any contract we enter into with them or you.</p>
                            <p>Advertisers and advertising networks that require the data to select and serve relevant adverts to you and others. To be clear, we will not disclose information about identifiable individuals to our advertisers, but we may provide them with aggregate information about our users (for example, we may inform them that 500 men aged under 30 have clicked on their advertisement on any given day). We may also use such aggregate information to help advertisers reach the kind of audience they want to target (for example, women in SW1). We may make use of the personal data we have collected from you to enable us to comply with our advertisers&#8217; wishes by displaying their advertisement to that target audience.</p>
                            <p>Analytics and search engine providers that assist us in the improvement and optimisation of our Site.</p>
                            <p>In the event we go through a business transition, for example, a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of part or all of our assets, we may disclose your personal information to third parties and your personal data held may be among one of the assets transferred.</p>
                            <p>If we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our terms of use and other agreements; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of VEFA , our customers, or others.

                            <p><strong>Where We Store Your Personal Information</strong></p>
                            <p>The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area (&#8220;EEA&#8221;). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff maybe engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. VEFA will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.</p>
                            <p>All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our Site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.</p>
                            <p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our Site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.</p>

                            <p><strong>Your Rights</strong></p>
                            <p>You have the right to ask us not to process your personal data for marketing purposes. We will usually inform you (before collecting your data) if we intend to use your data for such purposes or if we intend to disclose your information to any third party for such purposes. You can exercise your right to prevent such processing by checking certain boxes on the forms we use to collect your data. You can also exercise the right at any time by contacting us at VEFA, Irwin Mitchell, Fourth Floor, 19 Berkeley Street, London, W1J 8ED or email <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#771316031607051e0116140e37071205111214031b0e0407181c12195914181a"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="771316031607051e0116140e37071205111214031b0e0407181c12195914181a">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.</p>
                            <p>Under the GDPR, you also have the right to:<br />
                            <strong>Request access to your personal data </strong>(commonly known as a &#8220;data subject access request&#8221;). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</p>
                            <p><strong>Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you.</strong> This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</p>
                            <p><strong>Request erasure of your personal data. </strong>This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</p>
                            <p><strong>Object to processing of your personal data </strong> where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</p>
                            <p><strong>Request restriction of processing of your personal data. </strong>This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data&#8217;s accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.<br />
                            Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</p>
                            <p><strong>Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. </strong>However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</p>
                            <p>Our Site may, from time to time, contain links to and from the websites of our partner networks, advertisers and affiliates. If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies. Please check these policies before you submit any personal data to these websites.</p>

                            <p><strong>Access to Information</strong></p>
                            <p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights listed above). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p>
                            <p>Please contact us by emailing <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d8bcb9acb9a8aab1aeb9bba198a8bdaabebdbbacb4a1aba8b7b3bdb6f6bbb7b5"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="e48085908594968d9285879da494819682818790889d97948b8f818aca878b89">[email&#160;protected]</span></a> should you wish to request access to such information or if you have any queries or concerns about our use of any personal data relating to you. We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p>
